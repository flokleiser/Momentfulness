        ((Wallpaper))
            (vectorbased?)
                (Illustrator maybe convert to pixelart)
                    (Convert to svg and create canvas to animate/scale)

            [art style:] 
                (cartoon-y)
                (pixelated)
                ("lofi")

            (2/3 different variants maybe seasons)

            (look into glsl)

            (html5 canvas + js.)

        ((Pixel art))

            (draw in photoshop/illustrator)

            (google for atmospheric landscapes/cozy images)
