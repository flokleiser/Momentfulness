# Hausaufgabe Interaction Design ZHdK, Thema: "im-Moment"

## Description/general idea:

peaceful atmospheric images/environment to get a break from a busy day, to relax with, to get lost in, and to tune out. 

## To-Do:

### <ins>General:</ins>

- [ ] Figure out how to host from github?

- [ ] figure out pixelate filter

- [ ] Move rain to different file?

- [ ] slider to fade between?

- [ ] Figure out how to make it centered on screen
- [ ] Figure out how to make a more calm background (not white) 

- [ ] Figure out how to make different images appear first
- [ ] then figure out how to make them fade in (globalAlpha, look into save() and restore())

- [ ] Fade between images -> maybe make two canvases?

- [ ] Take image --> pixelate --> add elements

- [ ] figure out how to render on my nextjs page?

- [ ] Research workflow --> look into https://github.com/aleha84/simple.canvas.core2?tab=readme-ov-file
- [ ] Figure out a good project structure

- [x] Figure out how to make it fill screen (resizing up and down)
- [x] Add buttons/toggles for all 5 images

### Ideas for images:

- [ ] Night --> northern lights, stars
- [ ] Half night --> smoking chimneys
- [ ] Clouds --> rain (or snow) --> check out lightinggenerator
- [ ] Day --> small clouds, airplanes (?)


- [ ] Different times of day (day/night)
- [ ] Different weather (rain/cloudy/sunny etc)

- [ ] Smoking chimneys
- [ ] Rain
- [ ] Snow?

        ((Wallpaper))
            (vectorbased?)
                (Illustrator maybe convert to pixelart)
                    (Convert to svg and create canvas to animate/scale)

            [art style:] 
                (cartoon-y)
                (pixelated)
                ("lofi")

            (2/3 different variants maybe seasons)

            (look into glsl)

            (html5 canvas + js.)

        ((Pixel art))

            (draw in photoshop/illustrator)

            (google for atmospheric landscapes/cozy images)
